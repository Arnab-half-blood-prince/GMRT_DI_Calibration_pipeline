# GMRT_DI_Calibration_pipeline
Direction-Independent Calibration Pipeline

A calibration, imaging pipeline for uGMRT data The pipeline folder contains a direction independent calibration pipeline tool. This is mainly designed for direction-independent calibration of uGMRT data set. I have tested this to Band 3 (250 - 500 MHz), Band 4 (550-850 MHz) and Band 5 (1050-1450 MHz) uGMRT data.

The relevant images for different data sets are also uploaded in the test folder. If everything works well you should expect a calibration output like these as give in the weblog under the test folder.

If you use it and find any problem kindly let me know. Any suggestions regarding improvements of the pipeline is welcome.

The direction-dependent calibration for uGMRT wide-band data is a ongoing work and not finished yet.
