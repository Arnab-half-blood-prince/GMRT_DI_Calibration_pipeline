1. Go to GMRT_pipeline_work.py file 
2. In the pipepath give the path of the pipeline (where the py files are present) (line 80) 


So change this accordingly. 

After that you are good to go. 

Copy your data into a folder.

Go to that folder 
Open CASA
then  $execfile('path/GMRT_pipeline_work.py')

in the file name give the ms file name without extension (eg. if file name is GWB.ms then give only GWB) 

then yes for hanning smoothing and yes for saving the model data column. 

then it will start working 

In the end you will get a weblog where all the relevant images are stored and the ms will have a calibrated data column. 
Split the calibrated data column of the target and proceed to imaging.
